wxWidgets is an efficient cross-platform GUI library for C++. However, wxWidgets can be quite difficult to set up, especially for new users.

This template project addresses this high barrier of entry. 

**Notable features you get with this template**
- Easy compilation for Windows, macOS, and Linux, using a single codebase, with preconfigured Xcode, Visual Studio, and Make files.
- [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder) integration – build your interface quickly in their fantastic visual editor!
- Windows High DPI Awareness, and helper functions to easily scale your UI to high resolution displays
- Application icons – simply replace the relevant icon file
- Portable  – the library is contained inside, so no need to install the library to every computer. If you do not want this, you can remove the library from the project easily. [More Info](https://github.com/Ravbug/wxWidgetsTemplate/wiki/Referencing-wxWidgets-Externally-(Non-portable))

## Updating the wxWidgets version
Updating the wxWidgets version this project uses is as simple as overwriting the `wxWidgets` folder with the one for the new version.
