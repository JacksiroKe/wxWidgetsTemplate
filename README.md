wxWidgets is an efficient cross-platform GUI library for C++. However, wxWidgets is quite difficult to set up.
This template project fixes that. It contains a Mac Xcode project, a Windows Visual Studio project, and two bash scripts for Linux.
All you need to do is start writing your app! Everything has been set up.

## How to use
1. Download this repository as a zip (Don't command line clone!), and unzip it.
2. See the [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/Ravbug/wxWidgetsTemplate/wiki/Building-the-Projects) on the Wiki.  
3. Open the Xcode project, Visual Studio project, or main.cpp in your preferred editor.
4. Start writing your code!
Additional instructions are on the Wiki.
