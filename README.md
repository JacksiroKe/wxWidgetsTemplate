wxWidgets is an efficient cross-platform GUI library for C++. It supports other languages as well. However, wxWidgets is quite difficult to set up.
This is a template project for wxWidgets C++. It contains a Mac Xcode project, a Windows Visual Studio project, and two bash scripts for Linux.
All you need to do is start coding! Everything has been set up.
